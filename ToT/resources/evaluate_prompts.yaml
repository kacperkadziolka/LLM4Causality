step_3_template: |
  Given the following chain-of-thought:
  {previous_state}
  
  And the following candidate step:
  {recent_step}
  
  Please evaluate the candidate step against these specific criteria:
  1. EDGE REMOVAL CORRECTNESS (0-4 points)
  - Each edge removal must be justified by a valid independence statement
  - The conditioning set must be adjacent to both variables
  - All required edge removals must be identified
  - No incorrect edge removals

  2. EDGE RETENTION CORRECTNESS (0-3 points) 
  - Edges that should remain must be explicitly justified
  - No edges should be incorrectly retained
  - Reasoning must follow the PC algorithm rules

  3. TECHNICAL ACCURACY (0-3 points)
  - Correct application of independence statements
  - Proper handling of conditioning sets
  - Clear documentation of each decision
  
  Constraints to verify:
  {instruction_constraints}
  
  IMPORTANT:
  - Sum the points from all criteria (max 10)
  - Your response MUST be exactly one integer between 0 and 10
  - A score of 10 requires PERFECT adherence to all criteria
  - Deduct points for ANY deviation from correct application
  - Do NOT include any explanation

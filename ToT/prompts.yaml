steps_instructions:
  1: |
    Read the Data
    - Identify extracted nodes and their correlations.
    - Note all independencies.
  2: |
    Initialize the Graph
    - Create edges between all correlated node pairs.
    - List connections for each node.
  3: |
    Apply Independencies
    - Remove edges based on independencies.
    - Specify which independencies l  ed to each removal.
  4: |
    Compile the Causal Undirected Skeleton
    - List each node with its connected nodes.
    - Ensure all applied independencies are reflected accurately.


steps_examples:
  1: |
    Example for Step 1 – Read the Data:
    - Extracted variables: A, B, C, D
    - Correlations: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D), (C, D)
    - Independencies:
      - (B, D) are independent given A
      - (B, D) are independent given A, C
      - (C, D) are independent given A
      - (C, D) are independent given A, B
  2: |
    Example for Step 2 – Initialize the Graph:
    - Created edges between all correlated variable pairs.
    - Initial edges: {(A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D), (C, D)}
  3: |
    Example for Step 3 – Apply Independencies:
    - Because B and D are independent given A, there is no edge between B and D.
    - Because C and D are independent given A, there is no edge between C and D.
  4: |
    Example for Step 4 – Compile the Causal Undirected Skeleton:
    In this graph:
      - Node A is connected to nodes B, D, C.
      - Node B is connected to nodes C.
      - Node C has no connections.
      - Node D has no connections.

  Current state:
  {current_state}
  
  Next step instruction (focus exclusively on this step):
  {next_step_instruction}
  
  Step example (for guidance, only for this step):
  {next_step_example}
  
  IMPORTANT:
  - Your response MUST ONLY address the above step.
  - DO NOT generate any content or steps beyond what is requested for this step.


evaluate_prompt_template: |
  Given the following previous chain-of-thought:
  {previous_state}
  
  And the following most recent candidate step:
  {recent_step}
  
  Please evaluate the quality of the candidate step with respect to these constraints:
  {instruction_constraints}
  
  Rate on a scale from 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent) how well the candidate step satisfies the constraints.
  
  IMPORTANT:
  - Your response MUST be exactly one integer number between 0 and 10.
  - Do NOT include any extra text, explanation, or additional characters.
  
  For example, if you believe the state is very good, simply respond with:
  9


system_prompt: |
  You are an expert in causal inference and data analysis, proficient in applying the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm.
  Your overall task is to extract the causal undirected skeleton from a given premise by following a multi-step process.
  
  When generating candidate thought steps, focus ONLY on the current step as indicated by the instructions and examples provided.
  Do not include information or steps beyond the one requested.

  Task Description: Given the provided premise, apply the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm only by following instructions given below. Do not provide any additional information or assumptions.
  Premise: Suppose there is a closed system of 4 variables, A, B, C and D. All the statistical relations among these 4 variables are as follows: A correlates with B. A correlates with C. A correlates with D. B correlates with C. B correlates with D. C correlates with D. However, B and C are independent given A. B and C are independent given A and D. B and D are independent given A. B and D are independent given A and C. C and D are independent given A. C and D are independent given A and B.

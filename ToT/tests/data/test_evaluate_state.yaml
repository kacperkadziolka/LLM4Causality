      - Node E is connected to node A.
    
    Evaluation Criteria:
      - Must list every variable with its correct connections based on the correlations minus the removed edges from the independencies.
      - The candidate graph must reflect all applied changes accurately.
      - Consider missing or extra edges when scoring.
    
    Instructions:
      - Rate the candidate graph on a scale from 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent) based solely on how accurately it reflects the intended causal undirected skeleton.
      - IMPORTANT: Respond with exactly one integer (0–10) and nothing else.

    Given the following chain-of-thought:
    Task Description: Given the provided premise, apply the PC (Peter-Clark)
     algorithm only by following instructions given below. Do not provide 
    any additional information or assumptions.
    Premise: Suppose there is a closed system of 5 variables, A, B, C, D and
     E. All the statistical relations among these 5 variables are as 
    follows: A correlates with B. A correlates with C. A correlates with D. A
     correlates with E. B correlates with C. B correlates with D. B 
    correlates with E. C correlates with D. C correlates with E. D 
    correlates with E. However, A and C are independent given B. A and C are
     independent given B and E. B and D are independent given A and C. B and
     D are independent given A, C and E. B and E are independent given A. B 
    and E are independent given A and C. B and E are independent given A, C 
    and D. B and E are independent given A and D. C and E are independent 
    given A. C and E are independent given A and B. C and E are independent 
    given A, B and D. C and E are independent given A and D. C and E are 
    independent given B. D and E are independent given A. D and E are 
    independent given A and B. D and E are independent given A, B and C. D 
    and E are independent given A and C.
    
    
    Step 1 - Read the Data:
    For the given premise, the information extracted for the current step is
     as follows:
    
    - Extracted variables: A, B, C, D, E
    - Correlations: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (B, D), (B, E), 
    (C, D), (C, E), (D, E)
    - Independencies:
      - (A, C) are independent given B
      - (A, C) are independent given B and E
      - (B, D) are independent given A and C
      - (B, D) are independent given A, C and E
      - (B, E) are independent given A
      - (B, E) are independent given A and C
      - (B, E) are independent given A, C and D
      - (B, E) are independent given A and D
      - (C, E) are independent given A
      - (C, E) are independent given A and B
      - (C, E) are independent given A, B and D
      - (C, E) are independent given A and D
      - (C, E) are independent given B
      - (D, E) are independent given A
      - (D, E) are independent given A and B
      - (D, E) are independent given A, B and C
      - (D, E) are independent given A and C
    
    
    Step 2 - Initialize the Graph:
    For the given premise, the initialization of the graph is as follows:
    
    - Created edges between all correlated node pairs.
    - Initial edges: {(A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (B, D), (B, 
    E), (C, D), (C, E), (D, E)}
    
    List of connections for each node:
    - A: B, C, D, E
    - B: A, C, D, E
    - C: A, B, D, E
    - D: A, B, C, E
    - E: A, B, C, D
    
    
    And the following candidate step:
    Apply Independencies:
    - Because A and C are independent given B, remove the edge between A and C.
    - Because A and C are independent given B and E, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between A and C is already removed.
    - Because B and D are independent given A and C, remove the edge between B and D.
    - Because B and D are independent given A, C and E, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between B and D is already removed.
    - Because B and E are independent given A, remove the edge between B and E.
    - Because B and E are independent given A and C, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between B and E is already removed.
    - Because B and E are independent given A, C and D, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between B and E is already removed.
    - Because B and E are independent given A and D, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between B and E is already removed.
    - Because C and E are independent given A, remove the edge between C and E.
    - Because C and E are independent given A and B, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between C and E is already removed.
    - Because C and E are independent given A, B and D, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between C and E is already removed.
    - Because C and E are independent given A and D, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between C and E is already removed.
    - Because C and E are independent given B, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between C and E is already removed.
    - Because D and E are independent given A, remove the edge between D and E.
    - Because D and E are independent given A and B, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between D and E is already removed.
    - Because D and E are independent given A, B and C, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between D and E is already removed.
    - Because D and E are independent given A and C, this does not lead to any additional removals since the edge between D and E is already removed.
    
    Updated edges after applying independencies:
    - Removed edges: (A, C), (B, D), (B, E), (C, E), (D, E)
    - Remaining edges: (A, B), (A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (C, D) 
    
    List of connections for each node after applying independencies:
    - A: B, D, E
    - B: A, C
    - C: B, D
    - D: A, C
    - E: A
    
    
    Please evaluate the candidate step against these specific criteria:
    
    1. EDGE REMOVAL CORRECTNESS (0-4 points)
    - Each edge removal must be justified by a valid independence statement
    - The conditioning set must be adjacent to both variables
    - All required edge removals must be identified
    - No incorrect edge removals
  
    2. EDGE RETENTION CORRECTNESS (0-3 points) 
    - Edges that should remain must be explicitly justified
    - No edges should be incorrectly retained
    - Reasoning must follow the PC algorithm rules
  
    3. TECHNICAL ACCURACY (0-3 points)
    - Correct application of independence statements
    - Proper handling of conditioning sets
    - Clear documentation of each decision
    
    
    Constraints to verify:
    Apply Independencies
    - Remove edges based on independencies.
    - Specify which independencies led to each removal.
    
    
    IMPORTANT:
    - Sum the points from all criteria (max 10)
    - Your response MUST be exactly one integer between 0 and 10
    - A score of 10 requires PERFECT adherence to all criteria
    - Deduct points for ANY deviation from correct application
    - Do NOT include any explanation

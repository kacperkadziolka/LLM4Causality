    Task Description: Given the provided premise, apply the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm only by following instructions given below. Do not provide any additional information or assumptions.
    Premise: Suppose there is a closed system of 5 variables, A, B, C, D and E. All the statistical relations among these 5 variables are as follows: A correlates with B. A correlates with C. A correlates with D. A correlates with E. B correlates with C. B correlates with D. B correlates with E. C correlates with D. C correlates with E. D correlates with E. However, A and C are independent given B. A and C are independent given B and E. B and D are independent given A and C. B and D are independent given A, C and E. B and E are independent given A. B and E are independent given A and C. B and E are independent given A, C and D. B and E are independent given A and D. C and E are independent given A. C and E are independent given A and B. C and E are independent given A, B and D. C and E are independent given A and D. C and E are independent given B. D and E are independent given A. D and E are independent given A and B. D and E are independent given A, B and C. D and E are independent given A and C.
    
    
    Step 1 - Read the Data:
    For the given premise, the information extracted for the current step is as follows:
    
    - Extracted variables: A, B, C, D, E
    - Correlations: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (B, D), (B, E), (C, D), (C, E), (D, E)
    - Independencies:
      - (A, C) are independent given B
      - (A, C) are independent given B and E
      - (B, D) are independent given A and C
      - (B, D) are independent given A, C and E
      - (B, E) are independent given A
      - (B, E) are independent given A and C
      - (B, E) are independent given A, C and D
      - (B, E) are independent given A and D
      - (C, E) are independent given A
      - (C, E) are independent given A and B
      - (C, E) are independent given A, B and D
      - (C, E) are independent given A and D
      - (C, E) are independent given B
      - (D, E) are independent given A
      - (D, E) are independent given A and B
      - (D, E) are independent given A, B and C
      - (D, E) are independent given A and C
    
    
    Step 2 - Initialize the Graph:
    For the given premise, the initialization of the graph is as follows:
    
    - Created edges between all correlated node pairs.
    - Initial edges: {(A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (B, D), (B, E), (C, D), (C, E), (D, E)}
    
    List of connections for each node:
    - A: B, C, D, E
    - B: A, C, D, E
    - C: A, B, D, E
    - D: A, B, C, E
    - E: A, B, C, D
    
    
    Next step instruction (focus exclusively on this step):
    Apply Independencies
    - Remove edges based on independencies.
    - Specify which independencies led to each removal.
    
    
    Step example (for guidance, only for this step):
    Example for Step 3 â€“ Apply Independencies:
    - Because B and D are independent given A, there is no edge between B and D.
    - Because C and D are independent given A, there is no edge between C and D.
    
    
    IMPORTANT:
    - Your response MUST ONLY address the above step.
    - DO NOT generate any content or steps beyond what is requested for this step.
